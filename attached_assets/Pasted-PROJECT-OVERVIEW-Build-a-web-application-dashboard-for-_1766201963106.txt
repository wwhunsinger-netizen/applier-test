PROJECT OVERVIEW
Build a web application dashboard for job application reviewers. This is a gamified, performance-tracking system where remote workers review AI-generated job applications before submission. The system must support multiple users with isolated data, real-time performance tracking, leaderboards, and an extremely satisfying user experience focused on speed and gamification.

CORE CONCEPT
Users (appliers) log in to their personal dashboard where they see a queue of pre-loaded job applications. AI has already filled out the resume, cover letter, and application form. The applier's job is to review everything for accuracy (wrong company names, AI-generated text that sounds fake, typos, mismatched skills) and either approve or edit before submitting. Target time: 90-120 seconds per application. Target volume: 100 applications per day.

USER ROLES & AUTHENTICATION
Role 1: Applier (Primary User)

Each applier has their own isolated account
Can only see their assigned clients and jobs
Tracks personal performance, earnings, and stats
Competes on leaderboard against other appliers

Role 2: Admin (You/Wilson)

Can see all appliers' performance
Can flag applications for quality issues
Can assign clients to appliers
Can view system-wide analytics

Authentication Requirements:

Simple email/password login
Create test accounts:

applier1@test.com / password123
applier2@test.com / password123
applier3@test.com / password123
applier4@test.com / password123
applier5@test.com / password123
admin@jumpseat.com / admin123



Data Isolation:
Each applier sees ONLY:

Their assigned client(s)
Jobs in their queue
Their personal stats
Leaderboard showing all appliers (for competition)

Applier 1 cannot see Applier 2's client data, job queue, or detailed stats.
