INTERVIEWS TAB - Fixes
Fix 1: Move "Schedule Mock Interview" Button
Current: Button appears at top of page
New: Button appears at bottom of prep doc modal
Implementation:

Remove top-level "Schedule Mock Interview" button
Add button to bottom of prep doc modal:

[Prep doc content here...]

────────────────────────────────

We'll send a tailored thank-you email on your behalf after the interview.

[Close Prep Doc] [Schedule Mock Interview →]
Fix 2: Prep Doc Display & Download
Current: Text sections
New: PDF viewer with download
Admin Side:

Form fields to fill out (Company Overview, Recent News, etc.)
"Generate PDF" button creates formatted PDF from fields
PDF auto-saved and linked to interview

Client Side:

Opens prep doc modal → shows PDF viewer
Download button at top right
Client can download and edit offline
No in-app editing needed

Recommendation for Your Workflow:
Use form fields that generate PDF. Here's why:

Faster for you to fill out structured fields than format a PDF manually
Maintains consistency across all prep docs
Easy to update/revise sections without recreating entire PDF
Auto-generates professional formatting


DOCUMENTS TAB - Major Fixes
Fix 1: "Show Me" Button Animation
Current: Boring reveal
New: Pokémon evolution-style transformation
Animation Sequence:

Initial State: Old resume on left, "Your New Resume Is Ready" callout on right with "Show Me" button
Click "Show Me":

Background fades to dark overlay (80% opacity black)
Old resume floats up to center screen, enlarges to fill viewport
Everything else dims out


Transformation (2-3 seconds, skippable):

Resume glows with white border
Starts "morphing" - paper stretches/warps with wave effect
Glowing particles/sparkles swirl around document
Flash of white light


Reveal:

New resume appears in same center position
Sparkles/confetti burst
Celebratory glow effect
1 second pause


Return:

New resume floats down and shrinks back to normal position in viewer
Background returns to normal
Approve/Request Revisions buttons appear at bottom
Skip button available throughout (ESC key or X in corner)



Animation Library Suggestions:

Use Framer Motion or GSAP for smooth animations
Lottie for particle effects
CSS transforms for the morphing effect

Fix 2: Highlight & Comment Functionality
Implementation:
For Resume/Cover Letters/LinkedIn PDFs:

Use PDF.js with annotation layer
Client selects/highlights text
Lightbulb icon (💡) appears next to selection
Click lightbulb → text input appears: "Add your comment..."
Submit → comment saved with highlighted text reference
Highlights remain visible in yellow with comment indicators (speech bubble icon)

Comment Display:
[Highlighted text in yellow]
💬 "This should say 8 engineers, not 5"
All comments persist on document until:

Client approves (then comments disappear, doc locks)
OR client requests revisions (comments sent to admin)

Fix 3: Request Revisions Flow
When Client Clicks "Request Revisions":

Confirmation modal:

Request Revisions?

Your comments will be sent to Wilson for review.
You'll be notified when the updated document is ready.

[Cancel] [Submit Revision Request]

After submission:

Document changes to "Awaiting Revisions" state
Shows message:



   ⏳ Revisions Requested
   
   Wilson is working on your updates.
   You'll be notified when the new version is ready.
   
   Your Comments:
   • "Change 5 to 8 engineers" (line 12)
   • "Update revenue to 25%" (line 18)

Document viewer is read-only (can view old resume, no interaction)
No Approve/Deny buttons visible


Admin side shows:

Red badge on client card
"Needs Revision" status on document
All comments listed with highlighted sections
Upload new version → client sees "Your Updated Resume Is Ready" notification



Fix 4: Build Cover Letters Tab
Exact same structure as Resume:
Document Review - Cover Letters Tab

[A] [B] [C] ← Pills at top (toggle between versions)

─────────────────────────────────────

Left Side (70%):
Old Cover Letter (PDF viewer)

Right Side (30%):
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│  ✨                           │
│  Your New Cover Letter        │
│  Is Ready                      │
│                                │
│  We've crafted three versions │
│  optimized for different       │
│  opportunities.                │
│                                │
│  [Show Me]                    │
└───────────────────────────────┘
After clicking "Show Me":

Same Pokémon evolution animation
Shows Version A by default
Pills at top become active (can click B, C to toggle)
Fast switching between versions (no animation, instant swap)
Each version has independent highlight/comment capability
Single "Approve All" button at bottom (approves A, B, C together)
Single "Request Revisions" button (marks all as needing revision)

Fix 5: Build LinkedIn Tab
Same structure as Cover Letters:

Old LinkedIn PDF → New LinkedIn PDF(s)
A/B/C versions if multiple uploaded
Same animation, highlight/comment, approve flow


ADMIN SIDE - Prep Doc Workflow
Interviews Tab > Write Prep Doc
Interface:
Create Interview Prep Document
Google - Senior Product Manager
